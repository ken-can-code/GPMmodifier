            Change GPM of training replay in Panel Attack 
        </h1>
          
        <p>
            Paste original replay and aGPM multiple number, then click the button below.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, a 20gpm replay file with a 1.5x multiple would make it roughly 30gpm.
            <br>
            A 20gpm replay file with a 0.5 multiple would make it roughly 10gpm etc.
            <br>
            The same attack pattern is simply happening faster or slower.
            <br>
            A 1.5x multiple on a 3 minute replay sequence would make it 2 minutes, for example.
